# Extract-Epic-Flowsheet

Extracts flowsheet data from a PDF medical record generated by Epic and saves the data into a spreadsheet containing six columns:  Measurement, Value, Author, Date, Time, Page.  

Example:

(No, HIPAA police, this is not actual patient data.)


Epic is highly customizable.  So, a patient's printed/PDF medical record from one hospital utilizing Epic may look drastically different from another hospital's printed medical record.  Consequentally, you will almost certainly need to modify the flowsheet measurements to fit your needs (e.g. if 56 <= block[0] <= 59).  

This is a work-in-progress. No warranties as to accuracy, completedness, blah blah blah.

To-Do/Fix Me's:
1) Missing data that flows from one page to the next.
